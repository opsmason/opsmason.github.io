[Wil Wheaton](http://wilwheaton.net) has been doing a thing this month, were he posts at least one thing a day, something that he cares about, enjoys, whatever. My friend [Becca](https://rebeccabreedpepper.com/) participated in [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) and [NaBloPoMo](http://nablopomoguideunofficial.blogspot.com) last November. I am not a particuallry creative guy, but I always **want** to be creative. The blog-a-day seems like an easy way to start building those creative muscles. So, for the rest of December, I intend to post at least one thing a day.

So, why have I given up on Facebook and Twitter? Why am I posting over here, where I doubt anyone reads it, and I have no comments system in place? Primarily, I'm trying to escape my echo chamber. Right now, that means — honestly — being an Internet hermit, sequestering myself away to the old world of blogging. I intend to broaden my media horizons, as well. I did this a bit earlier this year.

In case you didn't notice,
