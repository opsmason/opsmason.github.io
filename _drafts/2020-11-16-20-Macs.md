Since my last post (October 23), well, a lot has happened, hasn't it? We've had a presidental election here in the United States. COVID-19 cases are on the rise. Mandalorian Season 2 has started back up.

On a more personal note, we went to Ohiopyle State Park in Pennsylvania at the beginning of November. The 15yo and I went on a 9.6 mile hike yesterday, in preperation for our Philmont trip next July.

I have worked a bit on a peice of fiction, but it is _so_rough_. I don't know if it'll ever see the light of day, but I'd like to put at least an hour a week into it. I dunno if it'll every be _good_, but it's an idea that has been bouncing around in my head for years, so I should try to give it some sort of form.

So, for this post, I'll share my thoughts on the Podcast 20 Macs for 2020 by Jason Snell. The basic idiea of this podcast is to profile 20 "influentail" Macintosh Computers since the first model in 1984. 

It has been a wonderful trip down memory lane. And, even though I hadn't thought I had owned many Macs, I realize I have worked with quite a few.

In high school, we had a lab of Macintosh IIs. Somehow I ended up in "Inependent Study Computer Science", which meant I got to help maintain the lab.

I also worekd on the student newspaper, where we had an SE30 and a IIsi. I'm sure I spent more time playing
