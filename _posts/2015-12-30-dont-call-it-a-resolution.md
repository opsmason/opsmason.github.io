title: Don't Call it a Resolution

Every New Years, I get the urge to blog again. I know, I know: resolutions are mostly bunk, and blogging is so last decade. But I still get the hankering, and I'll try to describe why.

New Years is a natural time to reflect on my life, and determine if it is heading the direction I want. Where am I making intentional change, and where am I on auto-pilot? What tools can I use to be more intentional?



Resolutions are in fact mostly bunk. Or at least they have been for me. I think it's just basic project management: It's fine to have big goals, but I won't succeed unless I break it down into individual tasks. And those tasks need to have a shorter time time horizon than 12 months. So, my goal won't be to blog three times a week all year, but maybe more like: "My goal is to blog three times a week, but for the next four weeks, I'll blog once a week, on topics W, X, Y and Z." These topics will be things that I am actively trying to improve in my life.

Second, I believe that a critical part of learning — and growing — is to share what I know. I have to sift through everything floating around in my brain, determine if I really understand the thing, and if I actually believe what I'm saying.

Past blogging attempts were exactly what you'd expect: family updates, some techno-babble, maybe an attempt at political skreed. Then came [Facebook][fb] that, for all accounts, seemed to kill personal blogging. At least in my circles. At least for me.
