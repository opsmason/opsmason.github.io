My office — like most, I presume — incorporates peer reviews into the annual review process. I'm not going to debate if this is good or bad, although I wonder if semi-annual reviews and raises wouldn't be more beneficial … but I'm not in a position to influence that. But oh, how I loath trying to remember 12 months worth of interactions, and try to provide helpful feedback.

We do have a tool to provide immediate feedback to our coworkers. It's a well-done tool,  providing examples and remnding us to focus on the situation and the impact, and how the feedback relates to our [leadership principals][lp]. We all know it's not enough to say "Amit is a great, helpful guy!" and it's nice to have a tool that reinforces the proper framework.

I really do think that's a great idea, but I'd need to build a habit of using it. Which means building a habit of paying attention to my coworkers so I can provide constructive feedback. So, how do I build the habit? This isn't a commitment to a goal (yet), but here an idea:

- Set aside one hour on Fridays to provide feedback.
- Create a "last week" smart e-mail folder, that would include both send and received email. Not only will this catch actual email, but it will catch tickets from our various ticketing systems.
- Scan for messages that inspire feedback, and move them to their own "feedback" folder.
- Writeup some feedback!

So, I just set up the "last week" folder and I have 1090 messages. And this has been a lite email week. So, I don't think skimming that much mail in an hour every Friday is achievable.

I could keep a journal of the week's interactions, but honestly I just don't think I could keep that up. I have enough
