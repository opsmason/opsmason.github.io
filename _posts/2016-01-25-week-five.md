Yes, I missed week four. There was no planning last Sunday, and there was no focusing on "bigger things." I have a few things I'm focused on at work — and I made some decent progress. But as for, well, even nailing down the "bigger things," it didn't happen. And my weekly planning session last night was derailed, as well.

But I'm not giving up. Thus this post. Its not progress, its just a heart beat. A pulse. A declaration that I intend to keep going.

So tonight I'll spend an hour (or two) focusing on the bigger things. Figuring out what directions I want to see my life going, and identify one or two six-to-twelve month goals. And finally make a plan for the week.

But one thing has been nagging at the back of my mind: am I going to focus on improving myself, or improving the world? As Andy Stanley puts it: [what breaks my heart][rs]? I need to do some thinking on that.
