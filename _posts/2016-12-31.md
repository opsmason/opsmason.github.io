title: To Write Better. Travelers.
---

Can I, once a week, sit down and write something interesting? Maybe comments on podcasts, blog posts ... something?

The other day I tried to write a review of [Catalyst - A Rogue One Story](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1840115320) at GoodReads and it's, well, sad. I just couldn't think of a way to describe the book, how it made me feel, what I enjoyed, whatever.

Maybe it's years of writing for work, where I try to be very clear and concise. I dunno. But I want to write better. I want to convey meaning and feeling. And supposedly that only happens if you write more. So here I go.

Now here's the rub, of course. I'd like to write about *important, meaningful* things. Things that matter to me, or that I want to matter to me. I don't want to distract myself away from those things. But to write about *them* — here — that requires a level of public vulnerability I'm just not willing to engage in. Further, if I'm going to write about *important things*, I don't want to just ramble on about my opinion, or the thing I heard on the radio. I want to present an opinion based on facts. So there won't be any of *that*, not today.

Instead, let me tell you about [Travelers](https://www.netflix.com/title/80105699).

Miriam and I watched the first two episodes the other night. I went into it knowing nothing more than "it's a time travel show." And I didn't want to know any more than that. It's a slow start. For the first 40 minutes, the facts trickle out slowly. Just enough to keep me interested, keep me going. But the last ten minutes were great. I saw it all coming together, and was enjoying every minute of it. And I was defenitley hungry for the next episode.

And that next episode was, well, fine. It was fine. The main thrill wasn't so thrilling. But we meet some new characters. We get to know the original characters better. We start to get a sense of the aparatus in place to make it all work.

*Travelers* is a little bit [Looper](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looper/), a little bit [Quantum Leap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Leap), a little bit [Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40293). But the characters are likable, and the premise is a unique appliation of older themes. I'm excited to see where the story goes.

In writing this, I see there are two sequels to *Pastwatch* ... I've added them to my GoodReads queue and hope to tackle them soon. When I do, I hope to write about them here.
