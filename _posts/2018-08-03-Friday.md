Vacation starts … now! Well, nearly so. I've turned off all the work-related apps on my phone and powered down the laptop. Tomorrow will be chores and packing the van. Sunday, we’ll make the five-hour drive for a week at the beach. We normally vacation in early July, but that's not the dice we rolled this year. It’s been a hectic year and summer for us all, so we’re looking forward to a week of *fewer* commitments.

I'll be spending some time next week working out my goals. And I'll be posting some thoughts and commitments here. There certainly is something to making goals public. First, a level of vulnerability. I’m admitting to my weaknesses. Second is the level of accountability, if anyone is actually reading this.

And why the on-again/off-again blogging? I feel a need to write. To share some of what is going on in my life. And I don’t want to do that on Twitter or Facebook or whatever. So, here I am.

I do have some fun, learn some tech skills plans for this blog. Stay tuned for that.
