Vacation starts â€¦ now! Well, nearly so. I've turned off all the work-related apps on my phone and powered down the laptop. Tomorrow will be chores and packing the van so Sunday morning me and the family can head out for a week at the beach. We normally vacation in early July, but that's not the dice we rolled this year.
