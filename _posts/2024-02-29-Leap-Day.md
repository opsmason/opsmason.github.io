I got an [Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-neptune-4-pro-fdm-3d-printer) for Christmas. I have a lot or project ideas, and thought it would be a good idea to document them as I go. So far, I have made:

* Keychain fobs, the same size as a quarter, to use at Aldi.
* A decorative star to cover the large bolt on our adress plaque.
* An insert for Aerodrome, based on Gridfinity, to keep things organized.

Tonight, I started making some 1.5 cm furniture risers for our dressers and nightstands, so our Roomba (affectionally named Kylo), will stop hetting stuck under everything.

I'll post more details on each project later.

The other rabbit trail I went down tonight was getting [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) running on my Mac, so I can preview posts before uploading them. I had already installed [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), but Ruby 2.7.4 wasn't working with Jekyll 4.2.2. I found a few other blog posts on getting Jekyll running on Mac OS 14.2. (Ventura), but what finally worked was just a small tweak to the official install steps:

1. `rbenv install 3.2.3` 
1. `rbenv local 3.2.3`
1. `gem install bundler jekyll`
1. `bundle install`

When trying to use Ruby 3.3.0 (the latest provided by rbenv as of this writing), `jekyll-4.2.2` reports an error with Logger:
```
~/.rbenv/versions/3.3.0/lib/ruby/3.3.0/logger.rb:384:in `level': undefined method `[]' for nil (NoMethodError)

    @level_override[Fiber.current] || @level
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	from /Users/mason/GitHub/lib/ruby/3.3.0/gems/jekyll-4.2.2/lib/jekyll/log_adapter.rb:45:in `adjust_verbosity'

```

Using the slightly older Ruby resolved this problem. I'll keep an eye out for a new release that resolves this issue.
