Every New Year, I get the urge to blog again. I know, I know: resolutions are mostly bunk, and blogging is so last decade. But I still get the hankering, and I'll try to describe why.

New Years is a natural time to reflect on my life, and determine if it is heading the direction I want. Where am I making intentional change, and where am I on auto-pilot? What tools can I use to be more intentional?

So, what are the tools that I plan to apply this year?

- Break it down, keep it SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bounded)
- Make it public. There is a truism that by writing down goals, and making them public, we are more likely to achieve them.

So, over the next few posts, I'll be outlining my goals, and the short-term tasks I'll be tackling. I'll also write about some of the underlying motives to it all.

In the meantime, Happy New Year, everyone!

PS: If you are reading this on January 31, 2106, Check out [St. Matt's end-of-year drive to fund Backpack Buddies][end-school-hunger]. This program provides meals to kids over the weekend ... meals that they may not otherwise have. The cost is $7/child/weekend, and 100% of donations go directly to purchasing food. The goal is $73,500; enough to feed 300 kids for the entire school year.
