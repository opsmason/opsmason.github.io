Starting week three of 2016, and I'm not giving up on my goals. Okay, I haven't really started them. Okay, I haven't really defined them. But I'm getting there.

I have a PDF of the [Spark Notebook][sn], and I am using it to organize my week. I'm blocking out the big items, making a list of short-term goals (which do feed into my larger goals, I'm pretty sure). I've also gone through a few of the Spark Notebook worksheets, that you can [find on their blog][snb]. I have even blocked out a night this week to go through the next worksheet!

I do have some categories for my larger goals. None of them are surprising, or all that original. In no particular order: 

- Transition responsibilities in [Cub Scouts][cs].
- Spend more one-on-one time with the people I love.
- Eat better / exercise.
- Set some professional goals.
- Have guilt-free fun.

Like I said, pretty mundane. But, I think that is why I want to make my journey public. I'm starting for a point of relative disarray; a point I imagine a lot of people are at. I figure, if I document my journey — and I actually get where I want to go (once I've figured out where that it) — then maybe that can be an inspiration to someone else.

One of the first exercises in the Spark Notebook is to decide on a "theme for your year." Yes, I rolled my eyes at that. But as I thought about it, I saw the greatness of this: Boil all of my goals down to one phrase. One phrase that I can use to remind myself of why I'm ignoring that donut; why I'm not playing Lego Dimensions tonight. For me, that theme is "Intentional." There are changes I want to make, but they aren't going to happen if I stay on auto-pilot. I need to be intentional about what I want. So having that one-word reminder to keep me on track … not a bad idea at all.

For me, Intentional will mean making a plan of when I'll tackle certain tasks, when I will spend time with people, when I spend time researching, and when I will in fact sit down and play Lego Dimensions.

## Technical Notes
I'm still poking around with [Jekyll][jrb] to get this blog doing what I want it to. (I have yet to be intentional in this … a project for a later date.) In the mean time, it will look a little rough.

I also plan to blog at least once a week: Sunday evenings after my personal weekly review. I'd _like_ to write more, but I also don't want this blog to be a distraction from what I am actually trying to accomplish this year.
